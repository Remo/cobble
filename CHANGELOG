0.0 - Beta Release - At this point, Cobble just populates its tables in the database.
  The only UI is a dashboard form with a button to refresh the tables.
0.1 - Fixed bug in cobble_page.php and cobble_page_theme.php.  Trying to call a member
  function from inside the class without $this->   For some reason this was not throwing
  errors for me, but did for JL - probably a difference in php.ini settings...
0.2 - Added a basic UI that allows a query to be selected and run with the results displayed
  in a table on the page.  Added ptHandle and ptName to the schema.
1.0 - Added an 'Export Results as CSV' button.
1.01 - Added records to CobbleAreas table for Global Scrapbooks and Layouts.
  This made it possible to fix the counts in the Areas query and correct the results
  of the "Blocks Ref'ing Areas not in Templates' queries.
1.02 - Refreshing Cobble tables is added as a Job when Cobble is installed or updated.
1.03 - Fixed bugs preventing refresh due to case sensitive table names in linux
  (bug was present in 1.01 and 1.02)
1.04 - Added 'Installed?' column to Themes query, Added 'Page Handle or Type' column to Areas query.
1.05 - Removed 'Refresh Tables' button and job.  Refresh is now done whenever the Cobble
  button on the dashboard is clicked.  Separated 'Overview Queries' from 'Diagnostic Queries'.
  Added some additional diagnostic queries.
1.06 - Improved the Page Types query so that SP handle conflict doesn't show as 'yes' if the
  single page has its theme overridden in site_theme_paths or theme_paths.  Previously all
  page types with handle 'full' were showing as 'yes' because of the core single page named 'full'
  Also added a new diagnostic query to show any SP handle conflicts.
1.07 - Coerced collation to utf8_general_ci in CobblePageType->updateSinglepageFlags()
  to prevent error if Collections.cHandle and CobblePageTypes.ctHandle
  happen to be set to different collations.
1.08 - Cleaned up the UI a little bit.  The query description and table header are now shown
  even if the query returns no results.  The description is necessary for the user to be able
  to understand what the empty result set means.  The table header is referred to by the
  description.
1.09 - Added collation coersion to more queries (I think I've got them all fixed)
  In CobblePages, a new function was added to update the template paths of pages assigned to
  theme-independent page types.  This fixed part of the problem Andrew was seeing.
  The CobbleAreas table now includes all areas defined in the database as well as those defined
  in templates.  This allowed the "Blocks Ref'ing areas not in..." queries to be improved.
  It also necessitated changes to the Areas query, since we don't want to show orphaned areas there.
  Fixed a tricky issue that can occur if a package installs a page type, then is uninstalled
  with pages left over that still reference the original page type.  It will be rendered by
  the default template in the page's theme.
